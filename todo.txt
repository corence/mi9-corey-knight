Known issues:
 - use "npm save" or something similar so that the appropriate node_modules can be downloaded onto other systems
 - the cucumber steps definition file is too long; sample data should be extracted into another file (or multiple files)
 - some cucumber steps parse the input string and some don't; this should be consistent
 - many names aren't great (particularly, the names in the Feature file)
