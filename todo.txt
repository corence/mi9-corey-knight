Known issues:
 - my text editor isn't indenting javascript properly -- i'll need to track down a vim module for that!
 - the cucumber steps definition file is too long; sample data should be extracted into another file (or multiple files)
 - some cucumber steps parse the input string and some don't; this should be consistent
 - also -- the noun "show" sounds too much like a verb. this should be replaced with another noun in function and variable names.
 - the project was prepared on Windows so I'm not sure what state the CRLF/LF line endings will be in
 - there's no git branching; all commits went to master instead of using git-flows
